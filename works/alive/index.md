intro: >-
  Ryukyu ALIVE is an information visualization system of the huge Web Archives
  named ‘Wonder Okinawa.’ This system renders the total contents of the digital
  archive in a 3D space. Up-to-minute access to the archive is dynamically
  visualized by analyzing a user’s access log. By using the metaphor of galaxy,
  a variety of interactions and visualizations are realized.

  title: Concept Detail
  content: >-
    The galactic space of Ryukyu ALIVE is constructed as a concentration of many
    stars (icons). Each icon represents a separate Web page in the digital
    archives. When a user accesses a certain Web page, the corresponding icon
    pops out to the outermost circle of the galaxy. Icons of pages with little
    access will be drawn gradually into the center of the galaxy, and will
    eventually be absorbed and become invisible. Fluctuation of the galaxy by
    icon pop-out and absorption represents overall status of the digital
    archives. The movement of the icons is reflected to the galaxy by analyzing
    accesses to the Web server 15 minutes before. Thus, ALIVE stands for Access
    Log Information Visualizing Engine of the digital archives. 


    The figure shows the user interface of Ryukyu ALIVE. The screen consists of
    three windows: 3D window, operation window and overview window. The 3D
    window shows a galactic space for which the digital archive is mapped
    three-dimensionally. Users are free to walk around in the galaxy. Moving the
    mouse cursor onto one of the icons in the galaxy shows the information of
    the corresponding digital archive in the overview window. Clicking the icon
    pops up another window for the corresponding digital archive. The operation
    window provides interesting functions: Seiza (constellation) to show or hide
    information according to categories, Wakusei(planet) to show all contents in
    a specific category in another galaxy and time machine to visualize past
    status of Ryukyu ALIVE.
