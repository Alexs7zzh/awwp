description_en: CT, City Tomography, is a project to reconstruct visible or invisible aspects of urban spaces as a three dimensional “information city” and explore it just like a computerized tomography (CT) of the human body. CT will provide information about the city by the way visitors cannot perceive from a physical urban space. It will enhance an overall image of the city through a reciprocal relation between a place and information.
